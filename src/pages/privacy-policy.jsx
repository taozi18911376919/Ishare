In the event that we sell a business, we will attempt to include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your Personal Information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy. Thus, any of your opt out requests will not affect our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these circumstances. Topixin also reserves the right to transfer your Personal Information to a third party in the event of a transfer of all or substantially all of Topixin's assets to a third party, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>Topixin may take your Personal Information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of Topixin to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and Topixin may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any manner in Topixin's sole discretion.</p>

Please contact Topixin at support@topixin.com to request that you not be sent any or all of such information.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-4'])}>7. Cookies</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>The use of "Cookies" is a standard practice among websites. A Cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer to uniquely distinguish your visit to a website. Cookies are most often used to track specific information regarding your activity on a particular website.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>When you visit our Websites and/or Services, we place a Cookie in a directory of your computer's hard drive. The information that Cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit and your registration information. Cookies offer you many conveniences for our Websites and Services. For example, they allow Topixin to recognize certain information, such as your browser type, so we know if you can view certain plug-ins like Macromedia Flash files. They also allow us to streamline your visit to the Websites and/or Services based on your previous visits.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>Cookies may be either permanent or temporary. Topixin uses both temporary and permanent cookies. A temporary or "session" Cookie is placed on your computer during your visit to or use of any of our Websites and/or Services and is deleted when you exit your Internet browser and/or turn off your computer. A permanent or "persistent" Cookie means that the Cookie stays on your hard drive until you delete it. You can delete our permanent Cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser's help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser's technical support. Topixin does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or any other highly sensitive Personal Information.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>You may configure your browser to accept or deny Cookies from our Websites and our Services. However, disabling or denying Cookies from our Websites and/or our Services may render parts of them inaccessible or may cause certain web pages not to properly load. There are also several services and websites which allow you to visit websites, including our Websites, anonymously. Again, if you use these anonymizing services or websites, you may not be able to access or use all of the web pages for the Websites and/or the Services.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-4'])}>8. Web Beacons</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>Topixin may use "web beacons," sometimes referred to as "clear gifs" or "web bugs," which is another way (instead of Cookies) to help personalize your experience on the Websites and/or the Services. Web beacons are typically invisible to you, and are generally embedded in very small clear graphics files. We may use web beacons to monitor certain non-personally identifiable information about you, including the URL of the page from which the web beacon originated, the type of browser used, the IP address of your computer, and the time you viewed the web beacon. We may also use web beacons to assist our third party advertising and/or content companies in providing the contact they believe you want to see. Web beacons are also used to allow such third parties to determine how many people view the advertisements and/or clicked through, and to assist in serving and managing advertisements and content. While web beacons do not collect Personal Information, the information collected by them may be used in conjunction with Cookies to identify aggregate information about users of our Websites and Services.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-4'])}>9. DMCA Information</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>Personal Information that you provide to us in association with a DMCA notification or counter-notification will be disclosed to third parties. All information contained in or associated with a DMCA notification will be disclosed to the alleged infringer. All information contained in or associated with a DMCA counter-notification will be disclosed to the initial claimant. See our DMCA Policy for more information on notifications and counter-notifications.</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-4'])}>10. Contact by Topixin</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>You do not have to participate in Topixin's mailing lists (newsletters) in order to use the Websites. However, if you elect not to receive such newsletters, you may miss valuable information on Topixin and/or its goods or services. Topixin will not contact you nor send you marketing materials, unless you have accepted to receive such contact or information (i.e., you have not opted out).</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-4'])}>11. Maintenance of Personal Information</p>
      <p className={classNames(css.subtitle, css['is-6'])}>You can access your Personal Information contained in Topixin's database by contacting us at privacy@Topixin. If you believe that any of your information is incorrect or needs updating, please let us know either at the email address listed in this section, or by U.S. Postal Mail to our address listed below (Attn: Accounts). Topixin will use reasonable efforts to correct your information and our records upon verification of the requested change.

We may also provide you tools to edit and remove the information or materials you make available on our Websites, but even after removal, copies of any information you post may remain viewable in cached, archived or otherwise saved media that is outside the control of Topixin. You are solely responsible for any information and materials that you choose to make available on public areas of our Websites and/or our Services, including those available on or through the use of Third Party Platforms.</p>

If Topixin discovers or is notified that Personal Information of a child under age 13 has been collected, Topixin will take reasonable steps to delete this information. All information volunteered to Topixin will be treated the same as information given by an adult. Topixin recommends that the Internet browsing behavior of any child should be carefully supervised by a responsible adult at all times.

Topixin makes access to your Personal Information subject to certain security measures, including technological controls such as "firewalls," in accordance with industry standards. When the use of a Topixin web page involves the transmission of Personal Information or confidential information, Topixin uses Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology to establish a secure connection between your computer and Topixin. SSL allows the transmission of encrypted information from your computer to Topixin and back again, and is currently the industry standard for Internet platform security.
